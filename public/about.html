                        <b>Pliny</b> is an online platform connecting citizens with their government.
                        <br><br>
                        This website is named after the Roman author <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliny_the_Younger" target="_blank">Pliny the
                                Younger</a>, who was a prolific writer of letters - many of which were addressed to
                        the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan" target="_blank">Emperor Trajan</a>.
                        His works remind us of the powerful effect written correspondence can have on government
                        and politics.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Pliny</b> allows the modern citizen to communicate their concerns and ideas - as
                        effectively as Pliny the Younger did - with a suite of easy-to-use tools.
